## React Sorting Algorithms

<!-- [Sorting-algorthms website](https://brian-react-sorting-algorithms.netlify.app/) -->

Visual approach to show how sorting algorithms work under the hood

Still under development:

**1. Algorithms**

- [x] Selection
- [x] Insertion
- [ ] Counting
- [x] Merge sort
- [x] Quick sort
- [ ] Shell sort
- [ ] Heap sort
- [ ] Radix sort
- [ ] Tim sort
- [ ] Pigeonhole sort
- [ ] Cocktail sort
- [ ] Sleep sort

**2. Functionalities**

- [ ] Speed selection
- [ ] Selection of number of sorting items
- [ ] Play-pause-restart
- [ ] Show number of comparisons
- [ ] Description section
- [ ] Compare two algorithms

- [ ] Code review and cleanup
- [ ] Styling
