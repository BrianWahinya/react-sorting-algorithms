## React Sorting Algorithms

<!-- [Sorting-algorthms website](https://brian-react-sorting-algorithms.netlify.app/) -->

Visual approach to show how sorting algorithms work under the hood

Still under development:

**1. Algorithms**

- [ ] Selection
- [ ] Insertion
- [ ] Counting
- [ ] Merge sort
- [ ] Quick sort
- [ ] Shell sort
- [ ] Heap sort
- [ ] Radix sort
- [ ] Tim sort
- [ ] Pigeonhole sort
- [ ] Cocktail sort
- [ ] Sleep sort

**2. Functionalities**

- [ ] Speed selection
- [ ] Selection of number of sorting items
- [ ] Play-pause-restart
- [ ] Show number of comparisons
- [ ] Description section
- [ ] Compare two algorithms
